# ExceltoAccess
This code runs inside MS Access and allows you to pull in your entire Excel Workbook, not one sheet at a time.

If you've ever used MS Access, you know the difficulty to import Excel Workbooks, as Access only allows one sheet at a time.

Go into 'Visual Basic' in MS Access and run this code after entering the correct folder for your Excel Workbook.
